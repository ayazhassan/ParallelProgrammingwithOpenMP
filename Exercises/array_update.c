// Warm-up Exercise: Array Update

// You have been given an array A containing N integers.
// Your task is to update all elements of array to some minimum value x, that is, A[i] = x; 1 <= i <= N such that the sum of this new array is strictly greater than the sum of the initial array.
// Note that x should be as minimum as possible such that sum of the new array is greater than the sum of the initial array.

// Input: Array A containing N integers and integer N denoting the number of elements in the array A.
// Output: value of x.

// Input Constraints: 1 <= N <= 10^5, 1 <= A[i] <= 1000

// Sample Input:
// 5, 1 2 3 4 5

// Sample Output: 4

// Write your code here

// Test Cases:
// 10, 6 8 9 10 11 12 15 17 18 20
// 8, 1 6 7 8 9 10 11 15
// 6, 1 2 3 5 8 10
// 10, 2 3 8 9 10 12 15 16 18 20
